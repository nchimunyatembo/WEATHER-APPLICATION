Creating a web application with Django involves several steps, including setting up the project structure, defining models, creating views, designing templates, and configuring URLs. Here is a plan to guide you through building a simple weather application:

Set up the django project and app: Create a new Django project and a new app for the weather application.
Define the data model: Create a Django model to store weather information (e.g., city, temperature, description).
Create views: Write the Python code to handle requests, fetch weather data (potentially from an external API), and render responses.
Design templates: Create HTML templates to display the weather information to the user.
Configure urls: Map URLs to the views.
Integrate a weather api: Add code to fetch real-time weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). This might involve installing a library and writing code to make API calls.
Create forms (optional): If you want users to input cities, create Django forms to handle user input.
Add static files (optional): Include CSS and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity.
Run the development server: Start the Django development server to test the application.
Explain the project structure and files: Provide a detailed explanation of the generated files and folders, and how they work together.
Finish task: Provide instructions on how to run the application and summarize the completed work.
